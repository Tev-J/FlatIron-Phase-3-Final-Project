    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "What is star topology?",
        "answer": "In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. This central hub manages the data traffic and acts as a conduit to transmit messages.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "How does a bus topology function?",
        "answer": "In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable, known as the bus. Data transmitted across the bus is available to all devices, but only the intended recipient, recognized by its unique address, processes the data.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "Can you explain what ring topology is?",
        "answer": "In a ring topology, devices are connected in a circular fashion, where each device is connected to exactly two other devices. Data travels in one direction, passing through each device until it reaches its destination.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "What is the primary advantage of a mesh topology?",
        "answer": "The primary advantage of mesh topology is redundancy; since devices are interconnected, data can take multiple paths to reach its destination, offering high availability and fault tolerance.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "What is the key disadvantage of a star topology?",
        "answer": "The key disadvantage of a star topology is that if the central hub or switch fails, it will result in network downtime as all connected devices lose their means of communication.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "What type of network topology is used in modern wireless networks?",
        "answer": "Modern wireless networks typically use a type of star topology, with a wireless router or access point acting as the central hub, and various devices connecting to it.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "How does a tree topology work?",
        "answer": "A tree topology is a variation of the star topology where star networks are interconnected through a central backbone. It allows for the expansion of an existing network, facilitating a hierarchical structure with different levels.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "What is a hybrid topology?",
        "answer": "A hybrid topology is a network architecture that employs a combination of two or more different topologies, such as mesh, star, ring, or bus, to create a network that leverages the strengths of its constituent networks while mitigating their weaknesses.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "How does data flow in a bus topology?",
        "answer": "In a bus topology, data flows in both directions along the central cable, and is available to all devices connected to the bus. However, only the device with the matching address to the data's destination address processes the data; others ignore it.",
    },
    {
        "topic": "Network Topologies and Architectures",
        "question": "What is the role of a central hub in a star topology?",
        "answer": "In a star topology, the central hub is responsible for managing data traffic. It acts as a conduit to transmit messages between devices connected to it, and often performs tasks such as data filtering to facilitate efficient communication.",
    },
